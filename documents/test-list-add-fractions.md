- 1/8 + 3/8 = 1/2    # denominators are the same; answer is reduced to lowest terms
- 1/5 + 2/5 = 3/5    # denominators are the same
- 1/7 + 3/4 = 25/28  # denominators are relatively prime
- 1/3 + 5/6 = 7/6    # one denominator is a multiple of the other; answer is an improper fraction
- 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4
- 3/8 + 5/12 = 19/24   # denominators have a non-trivial common factor; answer is already in lowest terms
- 3 + 7 = 10
- 0 + 7 = 7
- 0 + 0 = 0      # kernel of the feature
- prefer to give the answer as -3/7 instead of 3/-7
- 7/0 -> throw Illegal Argument Exception

## Equals

- 1/2 = 4/8 = 7/14 = 28374/56748
- 3/-7 = -3/7
- -9/-4 = 9/4
